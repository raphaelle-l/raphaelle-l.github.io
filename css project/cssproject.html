  <p style="font-family: 'Garamond'; color:#9B3A04; font-size: 18px" >OCT14-16 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; color:black; font-size: 16px">Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest conductor Aram Demirjian present a
powerhouse program highlighted by Vivaldi’s programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking
and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures the essence of spring, summer,
autumn, and winter through music that manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its
debut. Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in its return to Boettcher Concert
Hall.
The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on fate
that endures as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements,
Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of humanity’s most powerful works of art.
Among today’s best and brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit of dance,
movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic celebration that will have you on the edge of
your seat.</p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; color:black; font-size: 16px">History is replete with turning points and with the completion of his revolutionary Third Symphony,
Beethoven forever changed the idea of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and
Romantic eras, the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means to be human in a work that is
larger and more emotional than a symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion rises to the
forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very nature of humanity, while reimagining a future
for music filled with endless possibility. Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant
recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar’s Cello Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring
themes and quiet anguish that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes
center stage on Vaughan Williams ’Walt Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable
marriage of music and text, with Williams ’inspired music perfectly encapsulating Whitman’s noble,
humanistic aspirations. These works will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your
Colorado Symphony.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Garamond'; color:#9B3A04; font-size: 20px" >Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with Olga Kern</p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Garamond'; color:#9B3A04; font-size: 18px" >DEC 2-4 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; color:black; font-size: 16px">Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic compositions — placed himself among
the greats of the keyboard with the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with
towering grandeur, gorgeously lyrical melodies, and unmistakable Romantic spirit. For pianists what
Everest is to climbers, the Concerto in B-flat has become the standard against which all virtuosos must
measure themselves, featuring iconic opening flourishes and a pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite
Olga Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this cornerstone of the Classical Canon.
Your Colorado Symphony and Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” by the San
Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich’s stormy and brooding Tenth
Symphony. Written to symbolize the power of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and
complex orchestrations that mirror his own battles against Soviet oppression. Ending on a triumphant
note, this is a finale that will leave you breathless.</p>
